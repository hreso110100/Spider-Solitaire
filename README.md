**Manual for Spider-Solitaire** 

**Cards**

Cards have four distinct suits: hearts, clubs, diamonds, and spades. As well, there are 13 unique ranks: the king, the queen, the jack, the ten, the 9, the 8, the 7, the 6, the 5, the 4, the 3, the 2, and finally the ace. Each card has a suit and a rank and a deck consists of a complete set of each of the 52 unique cards.

**Layout**

The table can be broken up into three basic areas, the tableau, the stock, and the foundation. In this version you are only able to see the tableau. For foundations and stock you are able to see the count of cards.
